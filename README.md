# Rustlings Progress 🚀

Welcome to my Rustlings Progress repository! This serves as my personal learning journal as I explore the Rust programming language through the Rustlings course. Here, I document my journey, track completed exercises, and improve my Rust skills by solving hands-on challenges.

📌 About Rustlings

Rustlings is an interactive learning tool that provides small exercises to help developers get familiar with Rust syntax, ownership, lifetimes, and other core concepts. This repository contains my solutions and personal notes as I progress through the course.

📂 Repository Structure

This repository follows a structured workflow to track my learning progress efficiently:
```
📦 rustlings-progress
 ┣ 📂 exercises/       # All Rustlings exercises categorized by topics
 ┣ 📂 solutions/       # My completed solutions with explanations
 ┣ 📜 rustlings.toml   # Rustlings configuration file
 ┣ 📜 README.md        # This readme file
 ┣ 📜 .gitignore       # Ignoring unnecessary files
```
🔥 How I Work on Rustlings

To ensure a clean and professional workflow, I follow a branch-based development process:

Pull the latest changes from the main branch to stay updated:
```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
Create a new branch for each exercise:
```
git checkout -b exercise-name
```
Work on the exercise, solve it, and test:
```
rustlings watch  # Continuously checks for completion
```
Commit changes with a meaningful message:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Completed exercise-name"
```
Merge the branch back to main after completion:
```
git checkout main
git merge exercise-name
git push origin main
```
Delete the branch to keep the repo clean:
```
git branch -d exercise-name
```
